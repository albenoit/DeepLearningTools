Introduction
===============

Projet objective
####################

Train, monitor, evaluate and deploy/serve your Tensorflow Machine Learning models rapidly in a unified way !

DeepLearningTools philosophy
####################################

The DeepLearningTools framework is driven by a distinct philosophy that guides its development and usage. At its core, the philosophy revolves around empowering users to unlock the full potential of deep learning through simplicity, flexibility, and transparency.

    * **Simplicity**: The framework prioritizes a user-friendly experience, abstracting away complexities and allowing users to focus on their experiments.
    * **Flexibility**: It supports diverse scenarios like image classification, federated learning, regression, and image segmentation, providing a foundation that can be customized and extended.
    * **Transparency**: The framework promotes reproducibility, versioning experiments, and tracking settings. It offers tools to monitor and analyze model behavior, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

A quick presentation of the system is available `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tFetD27PK9kt29rdwwZ6QKLYNDyJkHoCLT8GHweve_8/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
